                        Hello Everyone,

                            My name is Teddy, and I came from Thailand.
                            I have been living in Vancouver since my high school in 
                            2012. I always set my goal to work in a game industry,
                            and I love game which I know that behind every game have
                            some special and cool stuff in it. Presently, I'm a student
                            at Vancouver Fil School studying in Programming for Game,
                            Web and Mobile.

                        Thank you
                        Teddy Nasahachart
