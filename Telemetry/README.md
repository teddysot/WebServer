# AppEnginePythonApp
A Starter template for a Google App Engine App using Python and Django

Base template for HTML5/CSS3/Python Google App ENgine app.  Get the code and structure and you will have a basic GAE app up and running. This template is ES2015+ compliant, will run in all browsers natively without the need for any "compiler" or 3rd party pre-processing solution (Babel, Node, Broswerify, etc NOT required).

Modern browsers continue to evolve and extend the basic functionality and as of ES2017 full module suport, class (style) based inheritance, scoping are all available to make it easy for non JavaScript programmers to get into JavaScript.

All of the traditional, functional traits of JavaScript are mantained but made easier to access as beginners and programmers coming from other languages.
